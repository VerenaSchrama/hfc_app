**Frontend: Profile Page Improvements**
--------------------------------------
- The profile page now displays real backend data for user goals, symptoms, cycle phase, and dietary preferences.
- The cycle phase is calculated from intake data (localStorage) and includes a supportive explanation for each phase or for users without a regular cycle.
- Dietary preferences from intake are now shown in the profile block. If none are specified, "None specified" is displayed.
- The "Update Profile" button has been moved inside the profile content block for better UX.
- The "Recent Progress" block uses real log data for strategy followed, energy level (now X/5), and mood.
