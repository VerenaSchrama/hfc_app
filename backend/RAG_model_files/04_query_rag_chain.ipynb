      "🧠 A1: During the luteal phase, it's beneficial to increase your intake of complex carbohydrates, such as millet and sweet potatoes, to stabilize serotonin and dopamine levels and help prevent mood swings. Nutrient-dense foods that provide more calories are also recommended. Foods like cauliflower, collard greens, daikon, onion, parsnip, radish, squash, and sweet potato can be particularly beneficial. Additionally, a diet rich in calcium and vitamin D has been associated with a reduced risk for PMS. Remember, every body is unique, so it's important to listen to your own body's needs and responses to different foods.\n",

However, to prevent bloating and other PMS symptoms, it would be beneficial to avoid foods that can cause bloating such as caffeine, salty foods, and dairy, especially before your period. Remember, everyone's body is unique and may react differently to certain foods, so it's important to listen to your body and adjust your diet accordingly.\n"

      " During ovulation, it's beneficial to enjoy fresh, raw foods such as vegetables, fruits, and salads. Juices and smoothies are also excellent choices. When it comes to cooking, lighter preparations like steaming or poaching are recommended. Foods that promote antioxidative well-being and provide vascular support for your ovaries, such as quinoa and corn, are also beneficial. These foods can help your body create the healthiest egg possible and ward off estrogen-driven symptoms like acne and bloating. Additionally, consuming a lot of fiber-rich foods during this phase supports your large intestine to increase transit time and help flush the estrogen that the liver is working hard to metabolize.\n"
