  "women, arousal involves four distinct stages: tumescence,\norgasmic plateau, climax, and the refractory period.\nUnderstanding the mechanics of your sexual response is the\nfirst step toward biohacking the arousal process to prime your\nbody for better orgasms and guaranteeing yourself consistent\npleasure.\nStage 1: Tumescence\nIt’s common knowledge that men get an erection as part of the\nsexual process, but did you know that women’s sexual\nanatomy undergoes a similar process of engorgement called",

Your\nbrain’s limbic system—the emotional center—sets off a chain\nreaction that leads to the release of a flood of neurochemicals\nthat make you even more interested in sex than you already\nwere.
